# Conway's Game of Life

## 🎮 Overview
This is a simulation of **Conway's Game of Life**, a cellular automaton devised by John Conway. The game simulates the life and death of cells on a 10x10 grid according to specific rules.

## 🧠 Game Rules
Each cell on the grid is either alive or dead. In each generation:
- A live cell with 2 or 3 neighbours stays alive.
- A dead cell with exactly 3 live neighbours becomes alive.
- All other cells die or remain dead.

## 💻 How to Run the Game
1. Make sure you have Python and 'pygame' installed.
2. Run the game with: python main.py
3. You will see a 10x10 grid with initial random cell states.

## 🕹️ Controls
- Click on cells to toggle them between alive and dead (before starting).
- Press **Spacebar** to start/pause the simulation.
- Press **C** to clear the board.
- Press **R** to randomize the grid.
- Press **ESC** to exit the game.
