# 🧬 Blob Life: A Friendly Twist on Conway's Game of Life

---

## 🎮 Overview  
**Blob Life** is a child-friendly, interactive simulation based on **Conway's Game of Life**, reimagined with colorful blobs, animations, themed backgrounds, sound effects, and a guided tutorial featuring Blobbo the blob. Designed to be intuitive for even a 5-year-old, it's both educational and fun!

---

## 🧠 Game Rules (Simplified for Kids)  
Each square (cell) can either have a **blob** or be **empty**. Every round (generation):  
- A lonely blob (0–1 friends) disappears.  
- A happy blob (2–3 friends) survives!  
- A crowded blob (4+ friends) disappears.  
- A new blob appears where there are **exactly 3 blob friends** nearby.
