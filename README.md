# Conway's Game of Life

---

## 🎮 Overview
This is a simulation of **Conway's Game of Life**, a cellular automaton devised by John Conway. The game simulates the life and death of cells on a 10x10 grid 

---

## 🧠 Game Rules
Each cell on the grid is either alive or dead. In each generation:
- A live cell with 2 or 3 neighbours stays alive.
- A dead cell with exactly 3 live neighbours becomes alive.
- All other cells die or remain dead.
